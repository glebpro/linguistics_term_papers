## Semantic Expectations in Child Language Comprehension

[[Paper](/evaluating-expectations.pdf)]

As adults people are able to comprehend the correct meaning of noisy speech on the fly. Errors thrown by regular speech and semantic mistakes are caught by the listener’s expectations of the utterance’s meaning as a whole. Adults have been shown to rely on these top-down se- mantic expectations as well as bottom-up phonetic cues when comprehending sentences. This experiment explores how children develop this skill, using a probabilistic modeling of their speech comprehension.

## Semantic Networks for Human Brain Modeling

[[Paper](/semantic-networks.pdf)]

This paper will explore the properties and applications of semantic network models with modeling human brain cognition. Starting with an introduction to semantic networks and cognition modeling, to considering two recent experiments which use them, concluding with how this field will continue to develop.
